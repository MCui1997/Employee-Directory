# Employee Directory

## Description

This employee directory is made using React.js and splits up the application's UI into components to manage component state and respond to user events. An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.


## Features

Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render. 

The user should be able to:

  * Sort the table by at least one category

  * Filter the users by at least one property.

## User Story

```
As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.
